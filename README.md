## PHP
Registration web page that inserts a user data into MySQL database, the details are as follow:<br>
1. The form includes a user personal detail: full_name, user_name, birthdate, phone, address, 
password, confirm_password, user_image, and email. <br>
"Use the appropriate client side Validation".
2. Include a header and footer pages.<br>
3. Maintain a User’s table in the database to check if the username is not registered before. If the 
user inputs a username that exists before, the form alerts the user to choose another username.
4. Upload the user image (the image will be stored on the server, while the image name is stored 
in the database).
5. Beside the birthdate field add a button that checks actors born in the same day using a third party MDBI API
